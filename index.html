      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Amine Allah Arfaoui, and I'm from Tunisia. My passion lies in all things computers â€“ especially computer science, development, and the visual side of graphic and web design. While I'm definitely not a professional web developer, I've picked up enough through hands-on experience and collaborative learning to confidently call myself a beginner.

      <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not immersed in code, you'll probably find me catching a football match â€“ especially if my favorite team is playing. There's nothing quite like the energy of the game, whether I'm watching it live or just yelling at the TV. I'm also a huge fan of video games; I love diving into different virtual worlds and tackling new challenges. And if you're looking for me out and about, chances are I'm on a quest for the best street food in Tunisia, always on the hunt for new flavors.

      <h2>The Bookworm & Offline Learner</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been more of a hands-on learner, so diving into web development felt like solving a puzzle. My first real exposure to HTML came from a local weekend bootcamp, where I got to build tiny pages right away. That immediate feedback was essential! After the bootcamp, I found myself constantly on Stack Overflow and various developer forums, soaking up knowledge from others' questions and answers. It was fascinating to see how experienced coders tackled problems. I even joined a few online coding communities on Discord, where I could ask silly beginner questions without judgment and get real-time help from peers. For deeper dives, I've relied heavily on interactive coding platforms like Codecademy, which break down concepts into bite-sized challenges. I'm still very much a beginner, but I've managed to piece together some basic JavaScript functions, mostly from collaborating with others on small projects.

      <h2>My Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        My aim with web development is pretty clear: I want to build fully functional, visually appealing, and bug-free websites from start to finish. That's precisely why I'm so drawn to community-driven learning and collaborative projects. I'm hoping to really dig deep into both front-end and back-end development, pushing my skills to a high level and growing every single day through hands-on practice and peer interaction.
