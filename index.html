      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
      <p>
        My name is ATALLAH Louay, from Tunisia. I love everything about computers â€” more specifically computer science, development, and graphic/web design.  
        I am no professional at web development, but I know a few things about it, which makes me a beginner.

      <h2>Me and Web Development</h2>
      <p>
        I have learned the basics of HTML throughout my education and other web courses online.
        In high school, I also studied HTML basics with Microsoft FrontPage â€” it's an old software but a good learning tool. It allowed me to see what every tag and element changed in the page through the split view it offered.
        I have learned a few more tags from online courses like 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp" target="_blank"><b>W3Schools</b></a> and 
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers" target="_blank"><b>Coursera</b></a>. 
        I also used <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a> for their great step-by-step explanations.
        I have also learned JavaScript (beginner level) in high school and used a few pre-defined functions.

      <h2>My Goals with Web Development</h2>
      <p>
        I want to learn how to make working websites â€” fancy, good-looking, bug-free websites from A to Z.
        That's why I am here in the first place.
        Iâ€™m hoping to learn to master the front-end and back-end of websites on a high level and improve my skills on a daily basis.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Other than being a student, I really enjoy listening to music. I have a taste for many genres from different cultures around the world, and I used to play the keyboards when I was young.
        Iâ€™m also a Hollywood movie enthusiast â€” I enjoy watching films of different genres and experiencing diverse stories.
        Iâ€™ve practiced a few sports in my childhood like soccer, baseball (which isnâ€™t popular in Tunisia), and I work out from time to time.
